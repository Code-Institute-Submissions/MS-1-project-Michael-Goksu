# Welcome
#### Welcome to my MS1 project
# Project information
#### So the idea with this project is to make an website that pushes myself as a developer, the website is a GYM website and E-cafe website. We've got the interactive part set up with the navbar buttons. Pictures, prices, products, subscriptions plans etc, all to sell the idea of this place.
