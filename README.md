# Welcome
#### Welcome to my MS1 project
# Project information
#### So the idea with this project is to make an website that pushes myself as a developer, the website is a GYM website and E-cafe website. We've got the interactive part set up with the FORUM buttons, so people post/comment/discuss as they like, albeit the forum will take you nowhere because the main project is the site, but for the forum, a regular forum website would be there. We've got top 5 favourites from customers, events, customer quotes, registration will come in the future.
